# Kergoth's Personal Scoop Bucket

[![Tests](https://github.com/kergoth/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kergoth/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Excavator](https://github.com/kergoth/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kergoth/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml)

This bucket holds items which I use, but which are currently absent from the main scoop buckets. This is intended to be a temporary staging area prior to upstream contribution.

## How do I install these manifests?

```pwsh
scoop bucket add kergoth https://github.com/kergoth/scoop-bucket
scoop install kergoth/<manifestname>
```
